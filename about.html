        <p>I'm passionate about many things, and one of them is the art of dance.</p>
        <p>Fun fact: I've dabbled in the art of dance for over ten years. I deeply appreciate the art form, and my engagement in the dance community has led to numerous opportunities. People from various backgrounds enjoy participating in the art of dance. Creating and teaching choreography for shows has been a significant aspect of my journey. Sharing art with the community has provided a euphoric sense of fulfillment. I must add that dancing is not only a great form of art but also an excellent cardiovascular exercise.</p>

        <p>Once in a while, I enjoy the great outdoors! There is nothing more relieving than a nice hike with some fresh air. A couple of hikes I recommend are Mission Peak, Big Sur, and Sunol Regional Wilderness area.</p>

        <p>Last but not least! Gaming is one of the best indoor activities ever! I usually enjoy games such as RPGs (role-playing games), FPS (first-person shooters), and fighting games. A couple of games I have played are Valorant, League of Legends, Judgment, Grand Theft Auto, and Mortal Kombat. Gaming has plenty of benefits, both cognitive and social. Hence, I like to relax at home with a nice game to play.</p>
